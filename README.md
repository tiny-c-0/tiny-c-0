# Cumhur Senavci - Portfolio 

## About

Hi, I'm Cumhur! I have a technical background and B.S degree in Economics. After evaluating myself for a while, I found out that I have a great interest in  data and decided to become a data analyst/scientist.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Turkey's Import and Export: A Brief Analysis with Comparison
**Code:** [`Turkey's Import and Export`](https://github.com/tiny-c-0/data_analysis/blob/main/turkey_exports_imports.R)     
**Description:** This code contains data about Turkey's imports and exports. Action is to analyze and compare the effects of:      
1 - The categories of imports and exports,      
2 - Balance and volume of trade,       
3 - Total imports and exports.

### House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques
**Code:** [`Multiple Linear Regression`](https://github.com/tiny-c-0/data_analysis/blob/main/mlr.R)     
**Code:** [`Random Forest Regression`](https://github.com/tiny-c-0/data_analysis/blob/main/random%20forest.R)     
**Code:** [`XGBoost`](https://github.com/tiny-c-0/data_analysis/blob/main/xgboost.R)     
**Description:** The codes that I wrote for the same named Kaggle competition. Results can be seen in Kaggle.

### An Apriori Project: Market Basket Optimization
**Code:** [`Apriori Project`](https://github.com/tiny-c-0/data_analysis/blob/main/apriori.R)     
**Description:** Apriori solution of the dataset with the same name on Kaggle.

## Study Projects

**Code:** [`Homework 3: Basketball Free Throws`](https://github.com/tiny-c-0/study/blob/main/hw3.R)     
**Code:** [`Homework 4: World Trends`](https://github.com/tiny-c-0/study/blob/main/hw4.R)     
**Code:** [`Homework 5: Movie Domestic % Gross`](https://github.com/tiny-c-0/study/blob/main/hw5.R)     
**Description:** Homework codes that I made while taking the course.

### Testing the Effects of Several Variables on Turkey’s Exchange Rates, 1987-2017
**Code:** [`Turkey’s Exchange Rates`](https://github.com/tiny-c-0/study/blob/main/Project.Rmd)     
**PDF:** [`Turkey’s Exchange Rates`](https://github.com/tiny-c-0/study/blob/main/Testing%20the%20Effects%20of%20Several%20Variables%20on%20Turkey%E2%80%99s%20Exchange%20Rates%2C%201987-2017.pdf)        
**Description:** Final project for my undergraduate degree. Action is to analyze the effects of inflation, interest rates and GDP growth on exchange rates.

## Other Projects
### Breast Cancer Prediction
**Data:** [`Breast Cancer Data`](https://github.com/tiny-c-0/extra_activities/blob/main/breast_cancer.csv)      
**Code:** [`Breast Cancer Prediction`](https://github.com/tiny-c-0/extra_activities/blob/main/breast_cancer_prediction_(logistic_regression).py)      
**Description:** A python and a machine learning project. Basic prediction for the breast cancer rates, trained with logistic regression model.
